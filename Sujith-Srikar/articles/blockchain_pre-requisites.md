# Pre-Requisites to Learn Blockchain

Welcome to your first step in becoming a blockchain expert! This guide will help you understand the basics of blockchain technology in a simple and engaging way. Let's dive in!

## 1\. Understanding Blockchain

**What is a Blockchain?**

Imagine a digital notebook that everyone can see and no one can change. That's what a blockchain is! It's a way to keep records safe and honest without needing a bank or any other middleman.

**Why is Blockchain Important?** Blockchain helps us:

1. Stay Safe: No single person or group controls the information, so it's hard for anyone to cheat.
1. Move Money Fast: You can send money to anyone, anywhere, in seconds.
1. Be Fair: Everyone gets the same chance to be part of the system.

**How Does Blockchain Work?**

Think of a blockchain as a chain of blocks, where each block has important information and links to the previous one. This makes it almost impossible to change any information without everyone knowing.

**Real-Life Example:**

Imagine a big notebook where each page is a block. When you finish a page, you sign it and everyone sees it. The next page (block) starts with the summary of the previous one, so the chain continues securely.

- Web 3.0 proposes decentralization in which data is encrypted (coded) and stored in many MANY computers like yours and mine (if we enlist it as a node). Since

  itâ€™s encrypted, no third party can actually read what it is unless the person actually owns that data or gives access to it.

- You can think of it like this: This Google doc will be hosted by all computers in the network instead of a third party like Google. Only the people who I share with can read it and no one else has access to it. Also, everybody is rewarded for participating in the tokens/cryptocurrency, be it the computers who help host the doc, the creator etc (depending on the project).

## 2\. Consensus Algorithms

- **What is a Consensus Algorithm?**

  This is how the blockchain makes sure everyone agrees on the information in the blocks.

- **Popular Consensus Algorithms:**
1. Proof of Work (PoW): Like a puzzle race. The first to solve the puzzle gets to add the next block.
1. Proof of Stake (PoS): Think of it like voting. The more coins you have, the more voting power you get.
- **Real-Life Example:**

  Imagine you and your friends decide who gets the next turn in a game by either solving a puzzle (PoW) or by voting (PoS).

---
- It is the way transactions are verified. There are around 20 consensus algorithms.
- Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin) gives voting power to the people with the most hashing power. the problem with PoW is that it leads to centralization of miners in mining pools, giving Bitcoin a single point of failure, since 1 company already almost owns 50% of the hash power (Bitmain), defeating the whole purpose.
- Proof of Stake (used by Digibyte, OmiseGO, ARDR, Rhoc, Stratis, Req, Dash) or Delegated Proof of Stake (EOS, NEO, Ripple, Stellar) gives voting power to the people who own the most coins. However, this also leads to centralization, because then the wealthiest entities will have the most voting power, such as billionaires, banks, large companies and government, also defeating the purpose.
- Web of Trust (Skycoin) gives more voting power to nodes who have existed the longest.
- Tangle (IOTA) gives voting power to those nodes that send a transaction themselves
- Block Lattice (Nano) gives voting power to those nodes that send a transaction themselves
- dPoS (Lisk, EOS, NEO, ARK) elects nodes that performed well in the past. The downside is that the number of elected nodes is very small and the voting mechanism can be rigged
- PoS/PoW hybrid (Ethereum, Decred, Aeternity). A hybrid with the best of both worlds
- Here are a few more consensus algorithms.
1. Proof of Importance (NEM)
1. Proof of Devotion (Nebulas)
1. Proof of Authority (VeChain)
1. Loopchain Fault Tolerance (Icon)
1. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (Stellar, Zilliqa)
1. Proof of Stake & Trust (WTC)

## 3\. What Makes a Good Cryptocurrency?

- A good cryptocurrency should be:
  1. Fast: Transactions should happen in a blink!
       - That means they are able to process at least millions of transactions per second and possibly also billions.
  2. Fair: Everyone should have a chance to participate.
     - This means that their voting should be distributed over at least 10,000 to 100,000 different voters.
  3. Secure: No single person should control the system.
  4. Green: It shouldn't use too much electricity.
## 4. Get Proficient with Required Tech Skills

Before diving into Blockchain Development, hone several prerequisite technical skills, including:

- Programming Languages: Java, C++, Python, etc.
- Data Structures: Linked lists, binary trees, hashing, and more.
- Databases & Networking: Fundamental concepts for distributed systems.
- Cryptography: Understanding digital signatures, hash functions, and RSA algorithm.
## 5. Responsibilities of a Blockchain Developer

A software developer that specializes in blockchain technology is known as a blockchain developer. Software and system developers plan, create and test their work. The two main categories of blockchain developers are:

1. **Core Blockchain Developer:**
   - Builds and secures the blockchain system.
   - Designs the rules and ensures everything runs smoothly.
2. **Blockchain Software Developer:**
   - Creates apps that run on the blockchain.
   - Takes care of how everything looks and works.
